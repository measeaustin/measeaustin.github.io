          <p> Hello visitor! <br>

          I'm Austin, a recent CS graduate of the University of Wisconsin - Madison and current OMSCS student at Georiga Tech. The courses I've taken include Databases, Mobile Apps, 
            Machine Learning, Networking, Software Engineering, Algorithms, Numerical Methods, Digital Signal Processing and Microprocessors.</p>
            <p>
            The most rewarding of these was the Mobile Apps class, where I learned Android development. The final app my group made for the class is classed DateSync, an app that makes scheduling easier. The primary use of the app is to use NFC to exchange, anonymize, and find free time for the two users to meet. This can be useful at conferences, where you meet a lot of people but don't want to go through the arduous task of exchanging/ creating new contact information. The other members of my group were really passionate about the class and the project, and I really enjoyed working with them. My favorite moment, which can be seen in our git log, is the all-day followed by all-nighter we did to get the project finished a week before it was due. I feel that these trial-by-fires are the best opportunity to learn what someone is really like. <br>
            After taking the class I was inspired to learn more about other mobile frameworks. I worked for a start up in Madison doing iOS programming, fiddled with React-Native during winter break, and now I am part of a group making an Ionic app for my Software Engineer class. For those of you who don't know the difference, iOS (and React-Native) have a certain design constraints  put upon the UI development. Most notably, and the navigation  operations are supposed to operate in a headed graph pattern, with a single controller spanning the views. When I started iOS, I really wish I had realized this constraint before beginning, as it caused a lot of headaches as the app grew in size. I was a good life lesson that not all things should just be hacked together without actually learning the technology.
            </p>
            <p> 
              The most challenging was Machine Learning. I enjoyed the subject matter a lot, but the proofs were very different from what I'd done before.<br>
              A copy of my capstone paper is on github. It's meant to be Lab the class could do in the future. I encourage you to attempt to do it, as there should be no prerequisite knowledge needed to do it.<br>
            </p>
            <p> 
              The class I enjoyed the subject matter most in is Networking. I really enjoy the application algorithms used in different situations and how those came about. It's the class I most readily read ahead in the textbook, and will probably do side projects on in the future. <br>
              The final project is about optimizing lossy wireless networks using TCP. I think this is very important, especially as internet.org faces expansion problems and as the wireless telecom market place here in the US becomes more competitive/ new companies are created.

			 <p> I came to RC around 1 year ago, eager to get out of the frozen wasteland that is the midwest. I was originally hired to join an android development team, but there was a funding issue on that project so I was placed on supporting their legacy software solution. <br>
			 This transition was a let down, though formative. I learned a lot of general software engineering practices, what leads legacy software to depricate, and migrations to need 'grand redesigns in the sky'/ how to makes the transition effective. I also learned a lot
			 about what I do and don't want from my work/ employer.</p>

          <p> <u>I had three internships during my college career: </u></p>

          <p> The first I worked part-time (20hr/week) during my Sophomore year (Aug 2015 – May 2015) for Maverick Software Consulting, which then contracted me to Thomson Reuters, a legal software company. 
            I worked on a rigorous data scrapping projects to automate reading of legal documents and extracting metadata. I gained exposure to enterprise Java technologies, including AntHill and Spring-Batch. The project used Computer Vision to read data and extract other features (stamps, seals, etc), and we used decision trees to ascertain origin, author, plaintiff, result, etc. My responsibilities were securely intern work. Read PDFs, try to identify patterns, try to make system identify patterns based primarily of regex, and test thoroughly. I made a lot of friends and got exposure to the industry for the first time. For a sophomore year part-time job, it was a great experience. </p>
          
          <p> The second was at Philips Radiation Oncology Systems from May 2015 – May 2016. I found working in healthcare very rewarding, knowing the profound impact the software will have on peoples' lives. <br>
          I did a wide variety of things for this job, including networking work with DICOM, lots of linux DevOps ,
             IMPT work for optimizing Bragg peak interpolation, and parallel programming. I really enjoyed doing scientific software development because understanding the subject matter provided an added difficulty and dynamic to the development process. They gave me a great deal of independence and responsibilities toward the end the summer and I feel like I did a great job and enjoyed taking a leadership role. At one point I was even instructing both other interns and full-time employees on IMPT operation and how the code works.</p>
          
          <p> The third was at Cray, Inc, the supercomputing company, from May 2016 – Aug 2016. I worked on a better version of valgrind, optimized for a distributed system (MPI libraries). During the internship
            I learned a lot about optimizing code for different heterogeneous environments and workload managers. I also had the chance to learn how to do hybrid (GPU/CPU) programming. Cray has some of the smartest and most passionate people anywhere working for them; it was a fantastic environment to be around.<br>
            I really loved working on the Tools team. The software was so useful to people there and I know it will be only become increasingly useful in the future. One of my favorite moments not just there but at any workplace before was when another developer whom I'd never met before came to me just to thank me for adding some features to this tool. According to him, mission critical hours were saved because my work. It felt really great knowing how profound of an impact my work had been to some people.</p>
