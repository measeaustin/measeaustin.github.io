          <p> Hello visitor! 

          I'm Austin, a senior at University of Wisconsin - Madison majoring in electrical engineering and computer science, graduating May 2017. The courses I've taken include Databases, Mobile Apps, 
            Machine Learning, Networking, Software Engineering, Algorithms, Numerical Methods, Digital Signal Processing and Microprocessors.</p>
            <p>
            The most rewarding of these was the Mobile Apps class, where I learned Android development. The final app my group made for the class is classed DateSync, an app that makes scheduling easier. The primary use of the app is to use NFC to exchange, anonymize, and find free time for the two users to meet. This can be useful at conferences, where you meet a lot of people but don't want to go through the arduous task of exchanging/ creating new contact information. The other members of my group were really passionate about the class and the project, and I really enjoyed working with them. My favorite moment, which can be seen in our git log, is the all-day followed by all-nighter we did to get the project finished a week before it was due. I feel that these trial-by-fires are the best opportunity to learn what someone is really like.

            After taking the class I was inspired to learn more about other mobile frameworks. I worked for a start up in Madison doing iOS programming, fiddled with React-Native during winter break, and now I am part of a group making an Ionic app for my Software Engineer class. For those of you who don't know the difference, iOS (and React-Native) have a certain design contraints put upon the UI development. Most notably, and the nativigation operations are supposed to operate in a headed graph pattern, with a single controller spanning the views. When I started iOS, I really wish I had realized this contraint before beginning, as it caused a lot of headaches as the app grew in size. I was a good life lesson that not all things should just be hacked together without actually learning the technology.
            </p>
            <p> 
              The most challenging was Machine Learning. I enjoyed the subject matter a lot, but the proofs were very different from what I'd done before.  10 lines of Numpy translated to 3 proofs, 10 theorems and a copy of the London Tube Map.
              A copy of my capstone paper is on github. It's meant to be Lab the class could do in the future. I encourage you to attempt to do it, as there should be no prerequisite knowledge needed to do it.
              I'll probably persue this field more in the future, maybe take the Udacity course on the subject as it seems comprehensive. 
            </p>
            <p> 
              The class I enjoyed the subject matter most in is Networking. I really enjoy the application algorithms used in different situations and how those came about. It's the class I most readily read ahead in the text book. 
              The final project is about optimizing lossy wireless networks using TCP. I think this is very important, especially as internet.org faces expansion problems and as the wireless telecom market place here in the US becomes more competive/ new companies are created.
            </p>

          <p> I had three internships during my college career: </p>

          <p> The first I worked part-time (20hr/week) during my Sophomore year (Aug 2015 – May 2015) for Maverick Software Consulting, which then contracted me to Thompson Reuters, a legal software company. 
            I worked on a rigorous data scrapping projects to automate reading of legal documents and extracting metadata. </p>
          
          <p> The second was at Philips Radiation Oncology Systems from May 2015 – May 2016. I did a wide variety of things for this job, including networking work with DICOM, lots of linux DevOps ,
            and IMPT work for optimizing Bragg interpolation. I really enjoyed doing scientific software development because understanding the subject matter provided an added difficulty and dynamic to the development process. </p>
          
          <p> The third was at Cray, Inc, the supercomputing company, from May 2016 – Aug 2016. I worked on a better version of valgrind, optimized for a distributed system (MPI libraries). During the internship
            I learned a lot about optimizing code for different heterogeneous environments and workload managers. I also had the chance to learn how to do hybrid programming. </p>
